Testing some changes/errors

**hero.php controls the displaying of images on multiple pages of the Wordpress site.**

The `ul` from line 19-25 should be displayed on the page when I inspect the element. This isn't the case, instead 
I see the `:  Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in ` error, as shown in the image below.
